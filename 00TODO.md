TODO List
=========

- Make -R and -p 0.5 the defaults

- Strip hydrogens automatically

- Modify the code that finds whether a point is near to an atom
to have a probe size (different from the grid spacing).

- When checking solvent positions use a bigger probe size IF there
is only one neighbouring solvent point.
