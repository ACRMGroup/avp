./findvalues.pl ProThermSearch.txt | sort > pdb_tm.sort
..extracts the PDB code (mutant if there is one) and the Tm

./avtm.pl pdb_tm.sort > pdb_tm.mean
..averages the Tm for each PDB code

nohup nice -10 ./avp_protherm.pl pdb_tm.mean &> avp.out &
..Runs AVP on each PDB file to get the largest and total voids

./read_tmlist.pl pdb_tm.mean > avp_tm.out
..Calls void_tm_printout for each file and extracts the tm and
..void sizes - i.e. final results.

awk '{print $5/$3, $2}' pdb_tm.out | xgraph -P -nl
awk '{print $5/$3, $2}' pdb_tm.out | correlation
..show Tm vs total void volume per residue

awk '{if($4 <= 3) print $5/$3, $2}' pdb_tm.out | xgraph -P -nl
..same but high resolution structures only

awk '{print $6, $2}' pdb_tm.out | xgraph -P -nl
awk '{print $6, $2}' pdb_tm.out | correlation
..show Tm vs largest void volume

awk '{if($4 <= 3) print $6, $2}' pdb_tm.out | xgraph -P -nl
..same but high resolution structures only

awk '{if($3 <= 200) print $6, $2}' pdb_tm.out | xgraph -P -nl
awk '{if($3 <= 200)) print $5/$3, $2}' pdb_tm.out | xgraph -P -nl
(resolution makes no difference)


awk '{if(($3 <= 200)) print $5/$3, $2}' pdb_tm.out >tm_totvoidperres.amplot
awk '{if(($3 <= 200)) print $5/$3, $2}' pdb_tm.out | correlation
Correlation coefficient (Pearson's r) = -0.067815

awk '{if($3 <= 200) print $6, $2}' pdb_tm.out > tm_largestvoid.amplot
awk '{if($3 <= 200) print $6, $2}' pdb_tm.out | correlation
Correlation coefficient (Pearson's r) = -0.246582
