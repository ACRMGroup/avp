Unpack the distribution file:

        gzip -d AVP1.3.tar.gz
        tar xvf AVP1.3.tar

If you are using GNU tar, you can combine these two steps:

        tar zxvf AVP1.3.tar.gz

This will create a directory, AVP1.3

Now enter the src sub-directory and type make to build the software:

        cd AVP1.3/src
        make

Finally copy the executable to somewhere appropriate:

        cp avp /usr/local/bin

To get help on using AVP, type

        avp -h

or even better, read the documentation:

        acroread AVP1.3/doc/avp.pdf
