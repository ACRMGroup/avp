with measurements of the thermodynamic properties of the transition
between unfolded and native states, have defined the major components
of the forces that stabilize native protein structures. However, the
nature of the intermediates in the folding process remains largely
hypothetical. It is a fairly widespread and not implausible assumption
that the intermediates in the folding of a monomeric protein contain
the same kinds of secondary and tertiary structures that appear in the
native conformation, and that, although unstable, their lifetimes are
prolonged by forces similar to those that stabilize the native
structure. We wished to examine what happens if, during the folding of
a monomeric protein, regions of secondary structure come together to
form an intermediate of reduced instability. We applied calculations
of accessible surface area (a measure of hydrophobic stabilization)
and parameterized nonbonded energy calculations (measuring the
strengths of van der Waals forces) to identify the kinds of
stabilizing interactions that might be available to such an
intermediate. First, we analyzed the total buried surface area of two
types of proteins into contributions from formation of secondary
structure alone, interaction of pairs of secondary-structural
elements, the formation of the structure alone, interaction of pairs
of secondary-structural elements, the formation of the complete
secondary structure without the turns, and the complete native
structure. The formation of secondary structure alone, without
tertiary-structural interactions, buries roughly half the surface that
the complete structure does. We then analyzed in more detail the
approach of two alpha-helices to form a complex, as an illustrative
example of the nature of the interaction between compact structural
units which remain fairly rigid during their interaction. Many
features of the results are not limited to the interaction of
alpha-helices. (The results therefore neither confirm nor refute the
hypothesis that alpha-helices are intermediates in the folding
proteins). We find that the first forces to be felt upon approach
arise from solvent conditions on the relative position and orientation
of the two helices as does the close packing which optimizes the van
der Waals interactions at shorter distances apart. Therefore there
appears to be a range of distances in which hydrophobic interactions
could create a nonspecific complex between two helices in which the
side chains might have sufficient time to seek the proper
interdigitation observed in the native structure, where the two
helices are in intimate contact. Indeed, we find that only in the
final stages of approach is the native geometry the most stable; in
the region in which solvent-exclusion forces predominate, the
conformation with helix axes parallel is more stable than the native
conformation, in the cases we examined..."

origin of protein molecules. Arguments are presented which suggest
that the amino acid sequences of many globular proteins mainly

reduces to the 'editing' these random sequences. Physical requirements
for a functional globular protein are formulated and it is shown that
many of these requirement do not involve strategical selection of
amino acid sequences during biological evolution but are inherent also
for typical random sequences. In particular, it is shown that random
sequences of polar and amino acid residues can form alpha-helices and
beta-strand with lengths and arrangement along the chain similar to
those in real globular proteins. These alpha- and beta-regions in
random sequences can form three-dimensional folding patterns also
similar to those in proteins. The arguments are presented suggesting
that even the tight packing of side groups inside protein core do not
require very strong biological selection of amino acid sequences
either. Thus many structural features of real proteins can exist also
in random sequences and the biological selection is needed mainly for
the creation of active site of protein and for their stability under
physiological conditions."

during evolution in the buried core of three different families of
proteins. The variation of the whole core is very small (approximately
2.5\%) compared to the variation at individual sites (approximately
13\%). However, by comparing our results to those expected from random
sequences with no correlations between sites, we show that the small
variation observed may simply be a manifestation of the statistical
``law of large numbers'' and not reflect any compensating changes in, or
global constraints upon, protein sequences. We have also analysed in
detail the volume variations at individual sites, both in the core and
on the surface, and compared these variations with those expected from
random sequences. Individual sites on the surface have nearly the same
variation as random sequences (24\% versus 28\% variation). However,
individual sites in the core have about half the variation of random
sequences (13\% versus 30\%). Roughly, half of these core sites
strongly conserve their volume (0 to 10\% variation); one quarter have
moderate variation (10 to 20\%); and the remaining quarter vary
randomly (20 to 40\%). Our results have clear implications for the
relationship between protein sequence and structure. For our analysis,
we have developed a new and simple method for weighting protein
sequences to correct for unequal representation, which we describe in
an Appendix."  }

protein structure. They are usually expressed in terms of standard
sets of radii for atomic groups and of volumes for both these groups
and whole residues. Atomic groups, which subsume a heavy-atom and its
covalently attached hydrogen atoms into one moiety, are used because
the positions of hydrogen atoms in protein structures are generally
not known. We have calculated new values for the radii of atomic
groups and for the volumes of atomic groups. These values should prove
useful in the analysis of protein packing, protein recognition and
ligand design. Our radii for atomic groups were derived from
intermolecular distance calculations on a large number (approximately
30,000) of crystal structures of small organic compounds that contain
the same atomic groups to those found in proteins. Our radii show
significant differences to previously reported values. We also use
this new radii set to determine the packing efficiency in different
regions of the protein interior. This analysis shows that, if the
surface water molecules are included in the calculations, the overall
packing efficiency throughout the protein interior is high and fairly
uniform. However, if the water structure is removed, the packing
efficiency in peripheral regions of the protein interior is
underestimated, by approximately 3.5 \%."

dot surface of each atom to the point of intersection with neighboring
atoms. The combined occluded and non-occluded surface areas may be
normalized for the amino acid composition of the protein providing a
single parameter, the normalized protein surface ratio, which is
diagnostic for native-like structures. Individual residues in the
model which are in infrequent occluded surface environments may be
identified. The method provides a means to explicitly describe packing
densities and packing environments of individual atoms in a protein
model. Finally, the method allows estimation of the complementarity
between any interacting molecules, for example a ligand binding to a

method that works directly only on buried residues. The atomic packing
of individual globular proteins may vary significantly from the
average packing of a large data set of globular proteins. Here, we
demonstrate that these variations in protein packing are due to a
complex combination of protein size, secondary structure composition
and amino acid composition. Differences in protein packing are
conserved in protein families of similar structure despite significant
sequence differences. This conclusion indicates that quality
assessments of packing in protein structures should include a
consideration of various parameters including the packing of known
homologous proteins. Also, modeling of protein structures based on
homologous templates should take into account the packing of the
template protein structure."  }
